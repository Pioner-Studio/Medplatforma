    4: * strings.accessor.StringMethods : Accessor for Series.str
    5: * strings.base.BaseStringArrayMethods: Mixin ABC for EAs to implement str methods
    6: 
    7: Most methods on the StringMethods accessor follow the pattern:
    8: 
    9:     1. extract the array from the series (or index)
   10:     2. Call that array's implementation of the string method
   11:     3. Wrap the result (in a Series, index, or DataFrame)
   12: 
   13: Pandas extension arrays implementing string methods should inherit from
   14: pandas.core.strings.base.BaseStringArrayMethods. This is an ABC defining
   15: the various string methods. To avoid namespace clashes and pollution,
   16: these are prefixed with `_str_`. So ``Series.str.upper()`` calls
   17: ``Series.array._str_upper()``. The interface isn't currently public
   18: to other string extension arrays.
