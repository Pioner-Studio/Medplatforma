    2: This module is home to specific dtypes related functionality and their classes.
    3: For more general information about dtypes, also see `numpy.dtype` and
    4: :ref:`arrays.dtypes`.
    5: 
    6: Similar to the builtin ``types`` module, this submodule defines types (classes)
    7: that are not widely used directly.

    9: .. versionadded:: NumPy 1.25
   10: 
   11:     The dtypes module is new in NumPy 1.25.  Previously DType classes were
   12:     only accessible indirectly.

   15: DType classes
   16: -------------
   17: 
   18: The following are the classes of the corresponding NumPy dtype instances and
   19: NumPy scalar types.  The classes can be used in ``isinstance`` checks and can
   20: also be instantiated or used directly.  Direct use of these classes is not
   21: typical, since their scalar counterparts (e.g. ``np.float64``) or strings
   22: like ``"float64"`` can be used.
