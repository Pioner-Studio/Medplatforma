   23: Academic Free License (вЂњAFLвЂќ) v. 3.0
   24: 
   25: This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of
   26: authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the
   27: following licensing notice adjacent to the copyright notice for the Original
   28: Work:
   29: 
   30:      Licensed under the Academic Free License version 3.0
   31: 
   32: 1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
   33: non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration of the copyright, to do
   34: the following:
   35: 
   36:      a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a
   37:      collective work;
   38: 
   39:      b) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the Original
   40:      Work, thereby creating derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon
   41:      the Original Work;
   42: 
   43:      c) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and
   44:      Derivative Works to the public, under any license of your choice that
   45:      does not contradict the terms and conditions, including LicensorвЂ™s
   46:      reserved rights and remedies, in this Academic Free License;
   47:      d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and
   48:      e) to display the Original Work publicly.
   49: 
   50: 2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
   51: non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent claims owned or controlled
   52: by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the
   53: Licensor, for the duration of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale,
   54: have made, and import the Original Work and Derivative Works.
   55: 
   56: 3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred
   57: form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available
   58: documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor agrees to
   59: provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along
   60: with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor
   61: reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable
   62: copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to
   63: permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor
   64: continues to distribute the Original Work.
   65: 
   66: 4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names
   67: of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or
   68: service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this
   69: Original Work without express prior permission of the Licensor. Except as
   70: expressly stated herein, nothing in this License grants any license to
   71: LicensorвЂ™s trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other
   72: intellectual property. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer
   73: for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent claims other than the
   74: licensed claims defined in Section 2. No license is granted to the trademarks
   75: of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in
   76: this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under
   77: terms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise
   78: would have a right to license.
   79: 
   80: 5) External Deployment. The term "External Deployment" means the use,
   81: distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any
   82: way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone
   83: other than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those
   84: persons or made available as an application intended for use over a network.
   85: As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat
   86: any External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a
   87: distribution under section 1(c).
   88: 
   89: 6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative
   90: Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the
   91: Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any
   92: descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause
   93: the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent
   94: Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have
   95: modified the Original Work.
   96: 
   97: 7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that
   98: the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein
   99: by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the
  100: terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those
  101: copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately
  102: preceding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS
  103: IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without
  104: limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for
  105: a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK
  106: IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this
  107: License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this License except
  108: under this disclaimer.
  109: 
  110: 8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,
  111: whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the
  112: Licensor be liable to anyone for any indirect, special, incidental, or
  113: consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or
  114: the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss
  115: of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
  116: other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not
  117: apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
  118: 
  119: 9) Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to this
  120: License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this
  121: License and all of its terms and conditions. If You distribute or communicate
  122: copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable
  123: effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to
  124: the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake
  125: the activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative
  126: Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms
  127: and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty.
  128: Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and
  129: limitations (including вЂњfair useвЂќ or вЂњfair dealingвЂќ). This License shall
  130: terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted
  131: to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section
  132: 1(c).
  133: 
  134: 10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically
  135: and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this
  136: License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or
  137: counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work
  138: infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action
  139: alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other
  140: software or hardware.
  141: 
  142: 11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this
  143: License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the
  144: Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under
  145: the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The
  146: application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
  147: International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original
  148: Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be
  149: subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the
  150: appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this
  151: License.
  152: 
  153: 12) AttorneysвЂ™ Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or
  154: seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
  155: recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
  156: attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including
  157: any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this
  158: License.
  159: 
  160: 13) Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be
  161: unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary
  162: to make it enforceable.
  163: 
  164: 14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License,
  165: whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity
  166: exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License.
  167: For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by,
  168: or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition,
  169: "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or
  170: management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership
  171: of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial
  172: ownership of such entity.
  173: 
  174: 15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise
  175: restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not
  176: to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.
  177: 
  178: 16) Modification of This License. This License is Copyright В© 2005 Lawrence
  179: Rosen. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or communicate this License
  180: without modification. Nothing in this License permits You to modify this
  181: License as applied to the Original Work or to Derivative Works. However, You
  182: may modify the text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate your
  183: modified version (the "Modified License") and apply it to other original works
  184: of authorship subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in
  185: any way that your Modified License is the "Academic Free License" or "AFL" and
  186: you may not use those names in the name of your Modified License; (ii) You
  187: must replace the notice specified in the first paragraph above with the notice
  188: "Licensed under <insert your license name here>" or with a notice of your own
  189: that is not confusingly similar to the notice in this License; and (iii) You
  190: may not claim that your original works are open source software unless your
  191: Modified License has been approved by Open Source Initiative (OSI) and You
  192: comply with its license review and certification process.

  198: GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  199:                        Version 3, 19 November 2007
  200: 
  201:  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
  202:  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  203:  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
  204: 
  205:                             Preamble
  206: 
  207:   The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
  208: software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
  209: cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.
  210: 
  211:   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
  212: to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
  213: our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
  214: share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
  215: software for all its users.
  216: 
  217:   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
  218: price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
  219: have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
  220: them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
  221: want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
  222: free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
  223: 
  224:   Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
  225: with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
  226: you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
  227: and/or modify the software.
  228: 
  229:   A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
  230: improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
  231: receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
  232: incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
  233: encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
  234: software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
  235: The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
  236: letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
  237: source code to the public.
  238: 
  239:   The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
  240: ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
  241: to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
  242: provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
  243: users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
  244: a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
  245: code of the modified version.
  246: 
  247:   An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
  248: published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
  249: a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
  250: released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
  251: this license.
  252: 
  253:   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  254: modification follow.
  255: 
  256:                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  257: 
  258:   0. Definitions.
  259: 
  260:   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
  261: 
  262:   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
  263: works, such as semiconductor masks.
  264: 
  265:   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
  266: License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
  267: "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
  268: 
  269:   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
  270: in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
  271: exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
  272: earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
  273: 
  274:   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
  275: on the Program.
  276: 
  277:   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
  278: permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
  279: infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
  280: computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
  281: distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
  282: public, and in some countries other activities as well.
  283: 
  284:   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
  285: parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
  286: a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
  287: 
  288:   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
  289: to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
  290: feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
  291: tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
  292: extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
  293: work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
  294: the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
  295: menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
  296: 
  297:   1. Source Code.
  298: 
  299:   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
  300: for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
  301: form of a work.
  302: 
  303:   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
  304: standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
  305: interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
  306: is widely used among developers working in that language.
  307: 
  308:   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
  309: than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
  310: packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
  311: Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
  312: Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
  313: implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
  314: "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
  315: (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
  316: (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
  317: produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
  318: 
  319:   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
  320: the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
  321: work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
  322: control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
  323: System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
  324: programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
  325: which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
  326: includes interface definition files associated with source files for
  327: the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
  328: linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
  329: such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
  330: subprograms and other parts of the work.
  331: 
  332:   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
  333: can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
  334: Source.
  335: 
  336:   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
  337: same work.
  338: 
  339:   2. Basic Permissions.
  340: 
  341:   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
  342: copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
  343: conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
  344: permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
  345: covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
  346: content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
  347: rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
  348: 
  349:   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
  350: convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
  351: in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
  352: of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
  353: with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
  354: the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
  355: not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
  356: for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
  357: and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
  358: your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
  359: 
  360:   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
  361: the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
  362: makes it unnecessary.
  363: 
  364:   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
  365: 
  366:   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
  367: measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
  368: 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
  369: similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
  370: measures.
  371: 
  372:   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
  373: circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
  374: is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
  375: the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
  376: modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
  377: users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
  378: technological measures.
  379: 
  380:   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
  381: 
  382:   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
  383: receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
  384: appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
  385: keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
  386: non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
  387: keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
  388: recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
  389: 
  390:   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
  391: and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
  392: 
  393:   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
  394: 
  395:   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
  396: produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
  397: terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
  398: 
  399:     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
  400:     it, and giving a relevant date.
  401: 
  402:     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
  403:     released under this License and any conditions added under section
  404:     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
  405:     "keep intact all notices".
  406: 
  407:     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
  408:     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
  409:     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
  410:     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
  411:     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
  412:     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
  413:     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
  414: 
  415:     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
  416:     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
  417:     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
  418:     work need not make them do so.
  419: 
  420:   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
  421: works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
  422: and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
  423: in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
  424: "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
  425: used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
  426: beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
  427: in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
  428: parts of the aggregate.
  429: 
  430:   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
  431: 
  432:   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
  433: of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
  434: machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
  435: in one of these ways:
  436: 
  437:     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
  438:     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
  439:     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
  440:     customarily used for software interchange.
  441: 
  442:     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
  443:     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
  444:     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
  445:     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
  446:     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
  447:     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
  448:     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
  449:     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
  450:     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
  451:     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
  452:     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
  453: 
  454:     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
  455:     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
  456:     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
  457:     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
  458:     with subsection 6b.
  459: 
  460:     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
  461:     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
  462:     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
  463:     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
  464:     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
  465:     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
  466:     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
  467:     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
  468:     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
  469:     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
  470:     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
  471:     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
  472: 
  473:     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
  474:     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
  475:     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
  476:     charge under subsection 6d.
  477: 
  478:   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
  479: from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
  480: included in conveying the object code work.
  481: 
  482:   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
  483: tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
  484: or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
  485: into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
  486: doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
  487: product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
  488: typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
  489: of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
  490: actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
  491: is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
  492: commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
  493: the only significant mode of use of the product.
  494: 
  495:   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
  496: procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
  497: and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
  498: a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
  499: suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
  500: code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
  501: modification has been made.
  502: 
  503:   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
  504: specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
  505: part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
  506: User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
  507: fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
  508: Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
  509: by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
  510: if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
  511: modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
  512: been installed in ROM).
  513: 
  514:   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
  515: requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
  516: for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
  517: the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
  518: network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
  519: adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
  520: protocols for communication across the network.
  521: 
  522:   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
  523: in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
  524: documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
  525: source code form), and must require no special password or key for
  526: unpacking, reading or copying.
  527: 
  528:   7. Additional Terms.
  529: 
  530:   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
  531: License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
  532: Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
  533: be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
  534: that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
  535: apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
  536: under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
  537: this License without regard to the additional permissions.
  538: 
  539:   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
  540: remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
  541: it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
  542: removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
  543: additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
  544: for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
  545: 
  546:   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
  547: add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
  548: that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
  549: 
  550:     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
  551:     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
  552: 
  553:     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
  554:     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
  555:     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
  556: 
  557:     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
  558:     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
  559:     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
  560: 
  561:     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
  562:     authors of the material; or
  563: 
  564:     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
  565:     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
  566: 
  567:     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
  568:     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
  569:     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
  570:     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
  571:     those licensors and authors.
  572: 
  573:   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
  574: restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
  575: received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
  576: governed by this License along with a term that is a further
  577: restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
  578: a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
  579: License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
  580: of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
  581: not survive such relicensing or conveying.
  582: 
  583:   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
  584: must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
  585: additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
  586: where to find the applicable terms.
  587: 
  588:   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
  589: form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
  590: the above requirements apply either way.
  591: 
  592:   8. Termination.
  593: 
  594:   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
  595: provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
  596: modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
  597: this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
  598: paragraph of section 11).
  599: 
  600:   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
  601: license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
  602: provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
  603: finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
  604: holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
  605: prior to 60 days after the cessation.
  606: 
  607:   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
  608: reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
  609: violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
  610: received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
  611: copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
  612: your receipt of the notice.
  613: 
  614:   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
  615: licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
  616: this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
  617: reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
  618: material under section 10.
  619: 
  620:   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
  621: 
  622:   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
  623: run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
  624: occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
  625: to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
  626: nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
  627: modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
  628: not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
  629: covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
  630: 
  631:   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
  632: 
  633:   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
  634: receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
  635: propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
  636: for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
  637: 
  638:   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
  639: organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
  640: organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
  641: work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
  642: transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
  643: licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
  644: give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
  645: Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
  646: the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
  647: 
  648:   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
  649: rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
  650: not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
  651: rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
  652: (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
  653: any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
  654: sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
  655: 
  656:   11. Patents.
  657: 
  658:   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
  659: License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
  660: work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
  661: 
  662:   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
  663: owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
  664: hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
  665: by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
  666: but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
  667: consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
  668: purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
  669: patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
  670: this License.
  671: 
  672:   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
  673: patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
  674: make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
  675: propagate the contents of its contributor version.
  676: 
  677:   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
  678: agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
  679: (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
  680: sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
  681: party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
  682: patent against the party.
  683: 
  684:   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
  685: and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
  686: to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
  687: publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
  688: then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
  689: available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
  690: patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
  691: consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
  692: license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
  693: actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
  694: covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
  695: in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
  696: country that you have reason to believe are valid.
  697: 
  698:   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
  699: arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
  700: covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
  701: receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
  702: or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
  703: you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
  704: work and works based on it.
  705: 
  706:   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
  707: the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
  708: conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
  709: specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
  710: work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
  711: in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
  712: to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
  713: the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
  714: parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
  715: patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
  716: conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
  717: for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
  718: contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
  719: or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
  720: 
  721:   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
  722: any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
  723: otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
  724: 
  725:   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
  726: 
  727:   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  728: otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
  729: excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
  730: covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
  731: License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
  732: not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
  733: to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
  734: the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
  735: License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
  736: 
  737:   13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.
  738: 
  739:   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
  740: Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
  741: interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
  742: supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
  743: Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
  744: from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
  745: means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
  746: shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
  747: of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
  748: following paragraph.
  749: 
  750:   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
  751: permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
  752: under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
  753: combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
  754: License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
  755: but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
  756: 3 of the GNU General Public License.
  757: 
  758:   14. Revised Versions of this License.
  759: 
  760:   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
  761: the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
  762: will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
  763: address new problems or concerns.
  764: 
  765:   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
  766: Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
  767: Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
  768: option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
  769: version or of any later version published by the Free Software
  770: Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
  771: GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
  772: by the Free Software Foundation.
  773: 
  774:   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
  775: versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
  776: public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
  777: to choose that version for the Program.
  778: 
  779:   Later license versions may give you additional or different
  780: permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
  781: author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
  782: later version.
  783: 
  784:   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
  785: 
  786:   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
  787: APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
  788: HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
  789: OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
  790: THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  791: PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
  792: IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
  793: ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  794: 
  795:   16. Limitation of Liability.
  796: 
  797:   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
  798: WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
  799: THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
  800: GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
  801: USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
  802: DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
  803: PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
  804: EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
  805: SUCH DAMAGES.
  806: 
  807:   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
  808: 
  809:   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
  810: above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
  811: reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
  812: an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
  813: Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
  814: copy of the Program in return for a fee.
  815: 
  816:                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
  817: 
  818:             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
  819: 
  820:   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
  821: possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
  822: free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
  823: 
  824:   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
  825: to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  826: state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
  827: the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
  828: 
  829:     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
  830:     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
  831: 
  832:     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
  833:     it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published
  834:     by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
  835:     (at your option) any later version.
  836: 
  837:     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
  838:     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  839:     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
  840:     GNU Affero General Public License for more details.
  841: 
  842:     You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
  843:     along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
  844: 
  845: Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
  846: 
  847:   If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
  848: network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
  849: get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
  850: interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
  851: of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
  852: solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
  853: specific requirements.
  854: 
  855:   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
  856: if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.

  943:       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
  944:       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
  945:       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a

  947:       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
  948:       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
  949:       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
  950:       as of the date such litigation is filed.
  951: 
  952:    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
  953:       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

  961:           stating that You changed the files; and
  962: 
  963:       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
  964:           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
  965:           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
  966:           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
  967:           the Derivative Works; and
  968: 
  969:       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
  970:           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
  971:           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
  972:           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
  973:           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
  974:           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
  975:           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
  976:           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
  977:           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and

  979:           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
  980:           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
  981:           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
  982:           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
  983:           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
  984:           as modifying the License.
  985: 
  986:       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
  987:       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
  988:       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
  989:       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
  990:       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
  991:       the conditions stated in this License.
  992: 
  993:    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
  994:       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
  995:       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
  996:       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
  997:       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
  998:       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
  999:       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 1000: 
 1001:    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 1002:       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 1003:       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 1004:       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 1005: 
 1006:    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 1007:       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 1008:       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 1009:       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 1010:       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 1011:       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 1012:       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 1013:       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 1014:       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 1015: 
 1016:    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 1017:       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 1018:       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 1019:       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 1020:       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 1021:       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 1022:       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 1023:       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 1024:       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 1025:       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 1026:       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 1027: 
 1028:    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 1029:       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 1030:       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 1031:       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 1032:       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 1033:       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 1034:       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 1035:       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 1036:       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 1037:       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

 1084: 
 1085: You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this

 1107: 
 1108:     "Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it

 1147: either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate

 1150: Compiled form of the Package.
 1151: 
 1152: (3)  You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other

 1155: will be subject to the Original License.
 1156: 
 1157: 
 1158: Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source
 1159: 
 1160: (4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis

 1166: 
 1167:     (a)  make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder

 1170:     Version.
 1171: 
 1172:     (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not

 1174:     addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different
 1175:     from the name of the Standard Version.
 1176: 
 1177:     (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to
 1178:     make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others

 1180: 
 1181:     (i)  the Original License or
 1182: 
 1183:     (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to freely copy,
 1184:     modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same
 1185:     licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee
 1186:     received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified
 1187:     Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
 1188:     available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor
 1189:     Fees are allowed.
 1190: 
 1191: 
 1192: Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version
 1193: or Modified Versions without the Source
 1194: 
 1195: (5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without
 1196: the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to
 1197: get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such instructions must be
 1198: valid at the time of your distribution.  If these instructions, at any
 1199: time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you
 1200: must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
 1201: If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty
 1202: days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then
 1203: you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.
 1204: 
 1205: (6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without
 1206: the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to
 1207: the Source of the Modified Version.
 1208: 
 1209: 
 1210: Aggregating or Linking the Package
 1211: 
 1212: (7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or
 1213: Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting
 1214: aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the
 1215: Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other
 1216: components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license
 1217: apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
 1218: as included in the aggregation.
 1219: 
 1220: (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with
 1221: other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to
 1222: build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that
 1223: include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction,
 1224: provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.
 1225: 
 1226: 
 1227: Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version
 1228: 
 1229: (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that
 1230: merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause
 1231: the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, such works are not
 1232: considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the
 1233: terms of this license.
 1234: 
 1235: 
 1236: General Provisions
 1237: 
 1238: (10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or
 1239: Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using,
 1240: modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not
 1241: use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this
 1242: license.

 1418: 
 1419: Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
 1420: 
 1421: Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
 1422: conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
 1423: original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
 1424: and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
 1425: following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
 1426: exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
 1427: 
 1428:      Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
 1429:      intended for use by those authorized to give the public
 1430:      permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
 1431:      copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
 1432:      irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
 1433:      and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
 1434:      Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
 1435:      applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
 1436:      material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
 1437:      material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
 1438:      licensed material, or material used under an exception or
 1439:      limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
 1440:     wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
 1441: 
 1442:      Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
 1443:      licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
 1444:      licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
 1445:      the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
 1446:      example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
 1447:      copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
 1448:      licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
 1449:      other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
 1450:      the licensed material may still be restricted for other
 1451:      reasons, including because others have copyright or other
 1452:      rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
 1453:      such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
 1454:      Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
 1455:      respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

 1523:      available to the public including in ways that members of the
 1524:      public may access the material from a place and at a time
 1525:      individually chosen by them.
 1526: 
 1527:   j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright

 1540: 
 1541:        1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
 1542:           the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
 1543:           non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
 1544:           exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
 1545: 
 1546:             a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
 1547:                in part; and
 1548: 
 1549:             b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
 1550: 
 1551:        2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
 1552:           Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
 1553:           License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
 1554:           its terms and conditions.
 1555: 
 1556:        3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
 1557:           6(a).
 1558: 
 1559:        4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
 1560:           Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
 1561:           all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
 1562:           and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
 1563:           Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
 1564:           authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
 1565:           necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
 1566:           technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
 1567:           Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
 1568:           simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
 1569:           (4) never produces Adapted Material.
 1570: 
 1571:        5. Downstream recipients.
 1572: 
 1573:             a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
 1574:                recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
 1575:                receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
 1576:                Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
 1577:                Public License.
 1578: 
 1579:             b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
 1580:                any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
 1581:                apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
 1582:                Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
 1583:                Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
 1584:                Material.
 1585: 
 1586:        6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
 1587:           may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
 1588:           are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
 1589:           with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
 1590:           the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
 1591:           provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
 1592: 
 1593:   b. Other rights.
 1594: 
 1595:        1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
 1596:           licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
 1597:           privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
 1598:           the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
 1599:           assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
 1600:           extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
 1601:           Rights, but not otherwise.
 1602: 
 1603:        2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
 1604:           Public License.
 1605: 
 1606:        3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
 1607:           collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
 1608:           Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
 1609:           under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
 1610:           licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
 1611:           reserves any right to collect such royalties.
 1612: 
 1613: 
 1614: Section 3 -- License Conditions.
 1615: 
 1616: Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
 1617: following conditions.

 1664: 
 1665: 
 1666: Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

 1668: Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
 1669: apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

 1675:   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database

 1678:      Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
 1679:

 1684: replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
 1685: Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

 1731:        2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

 1777:      processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

 1819: Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
 1820: 
 1821: Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
 1822: conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
 1823: original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
 1824: and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
 1825: following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
 1826: exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
 1827: 
 1828:      Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
 1829:      intended for use by those authorized to give the public
 1830:      permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
 1831:      copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
 1832:      irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
 1833:      and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
 1834:      Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
 1835:      applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
 1836:      material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
 1837:      material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
 1838:      licensed material, or material used under an exception or
 1839:      limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
 1840:     wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
 1841: 
 1842:      Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
 1843:      licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
 1844:      licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
 1845:      the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
 1846:      example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
 1847:      copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
 1848:      licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
 1849:      other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
 1850:      the licensed material may still be restricted for other
 1851:      reasons, including because others have copyright or other
 1852:      rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
 1853:      such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
 1854:      Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
 1855:      respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

 1953:           non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to

 1996:                any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
 1997:                apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
 1998:                Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
 1999:                Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed

 2010: 
 2011:        1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
 2012:           licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
 2013:           privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
 2014:           the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
 2015:           assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
 2016:           extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
 2017:           Rights, but not otherwise.
 2018: 
 2019:        2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this

 2023:           collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
 2024:           Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society

 2145:      possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
 2146:      waiver of all liability.
 2147: 
 2148:

 2237: CC0 1.0 Universal
 2238: 
 2239: Statement of Purpose
 2240: 
 2241: The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
 2242: exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
 2243: subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
 2244: authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
 2245: 
 2246: Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
 2247: purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
 2248: works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
 2249: claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
 2250: and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
 2251: purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
 2252: contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
 2253: further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
 2254: reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
 2255: efforts of others.
 2256: 
 2257: For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
 2258: of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
 2259: Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
 2260: and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
 2261: and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
 2262: Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
 2263: effect of CC0 on those rights.
 2264: 
 2265: 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
 2266: protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
 2267: Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
 2268: to, the following:
 2269: 
 2270:   i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
 2271:   and translate a Work;
 2272: 
 2273:   ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
 2274: 
 2275:   iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
 2276:   depicted in a Work;
 2277: 
 2278:   iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
 2279:   subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
 2280: 
 2281:   v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
 2282:   a Work;
 2283: 
 2284:   vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
 2285:   European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
 2286:   protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
 2287:   including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
 2288: 
 2289:   vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
 2290:   based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
 2291: 
 2292: 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
 2293: applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
 2294: unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
 2295: and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
 2296: known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
 2297: action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
 2298: duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
 2299: extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
 2300: copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
 2301: commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
 2302: the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
 2303: detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
 2304: shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
 2305: any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
 2306: by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
 2307: 
 2308: 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
 2309: judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
 2310: shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
 2311: Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
 2312: is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
 2313: non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
 2314: unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
 2315: the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
 2316: provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
 2317: in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
 2318: purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
 2319: promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
 2320: of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
 2321: License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
 2322: applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
 2323: invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
 2324: affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
 2325: Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
 2326: and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
 2327: Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
 2328: 
 2329: 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
 2330: 
 2331:   a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
 2332:   surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
 2333: 
 2334:   b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
 2335:   of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
 2336:   including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
 2337:   for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
 2338:   other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
 2339:   discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 2340: 
 2341:   c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
 2342:   that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
 2343:   any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
 2344:   disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
 2345:   or other rights required for any use of the Work.
 2346: 
 2347:   d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
 2348:   party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
 2349:   CC0 or use of the Work.

 2568: THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
 2569: LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
 2570: CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
 2571: 
 2572: 1. DEFINITIONS
 2573: 
 2574: "Contribution" means:
 2575:      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
 2576:      documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
 2577:      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
 2578:           i) changes to the Program, and
 2579:           ii) additions to the Program;
 2580: 
 2581: where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
 2582: distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
 2583: Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or
 2584: anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include
 2585: additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software
 2586: distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,
 2587: and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
 2588: "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
 2589: 
 2590: "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
 2591: necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
 2592: combined with the Program.
 2593: 
 2594: "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
 2595: Agreement.
 2596: 
 2597: "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,

 2599: 
 2600: 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
 2601: 
 2602:      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
 2603:      Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
 2604:      reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
 2605:      perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,
 2606:      if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
 2607: 
 2608:      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
 2609:      Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
 2610:      Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
 2611:      transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
 2612:      object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of
 2613:      the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is
 2614:      added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such
 2615:      combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license
 2616:      shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.
 2617:      No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
 2618: 
 2619:      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
 2620:      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
 2621:      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent
 2622:      or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
 2623:      Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
 2624:      any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or
 2625:      otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted
 2626:      hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure
 2627:      any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a
 2628:      third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute
 2629:      the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
 2630:      before distributing the Program.
 2631: 
 2632:      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
 2633:      copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
 2634:      license set forth in this Agreement.
 2635: 
 2636: 3. REQUIREMENTS
 2637: A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under
 2638: its own license agreement, provided that:
 2639: 
 2640:      a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
 2641: 
 2642:      b) its license agreement:
 2643:           i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
 2644:           warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties
 2645:           or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties
 2646:           or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular
 2647:           purpose;
 2648:           ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability
 2649:           for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and
 2650:           consequential damages, such as lost profits;
 2651:           iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
 2652:           offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
 2653:           iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
 2654:           Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable
 2655:           manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
 2656:           exchange.
 2657: 
 2658: When the Program is made available in source code form:
 2659: 
 2660:      a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
 2661: 
 2662:      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
 2663:      Program.
 2664: Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within
 2665: the Program.
 2666: 
 2667: Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,
 2668: if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify
 2669: the originator of the Contribution.
 2670: 
 2671: 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
 2672: Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
 2673: respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
 2674: intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
 2675: includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
 2676: which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,
 2677: if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
 2678: Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
 2679: every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
 2680: damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and
 2681: other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
 2682: Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial
 2683: Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial
 2684: product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims
 2685: or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
 2686: infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)
 2687: promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)
 2688: allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial
 2689: Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The
 2690: Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
 2691: 
 2692: For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
 2693: offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If
 2694: that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers
 2695: warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are
 2696: such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
 2697: Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
 2698: Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a
 2699: court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the
 2700: Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
 2701: 
 2702: 5. NO WARRANTY
 2703: EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
 2704: "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
 2705: IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
 2706: NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
 2707: Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using
 2708: and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
 2709: exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the
 2710: risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to
 2711: or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of
 2712: operations.
 2713: 
 2714: 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
 2715: EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
 2716: CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
 2717: SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
 2718: LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
 2719: CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
 2720: ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
 2721: EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
 2722: OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 2723: 
 2724: 7. GENERAL
 2725: 
 2726: If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
 2727: applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
 2728: remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the
 2729: parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
 2730: necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
 2731: 
 2732: If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
 2733: cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
 2734: (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
 2735: infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted
 2736: under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
 2737: 
 2738: All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
 2739: comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
 2740: not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
 2741: such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
 2742: Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
 2743: reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
 2744: and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
 2745: and survive.
 2746: 
 2747: Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
 2748: order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
 2749: modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
 2750: publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to
 2751: time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this
 2752: Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The
 2753: Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement
 2754: Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will
 2755: be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
 2756: Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the
 2757: Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the
 2758: Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program
 2759: (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly
 2760: stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or
 2761: licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,
 2762: whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the
 2763: Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
 2764: 
 2765: This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
 2766: intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
 2767: Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
 2768: after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial
 2769: in any resulting litigation.

 2849:   apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
 2850:   the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition

 2863:   rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
 2864:   assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
 2865:   property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
 2866:   patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
 2867:   Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
 2868:   before distributing the Program.
 2869:

 2877:   receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
 2878:   (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
 2879: 
 2880: 3. REQUIREMENTS
 2881: 
 2882: 3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
 2883: 
 2884:   a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
 2885:   accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
 2886:   the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
 2887:   is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
 2888:   obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
 2889:   used for software exchange; and
 2890: 
 2891:   b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
 2892:   different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
 2893:      i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
 2894:      warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
 2895:      warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
 2896:      implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
 2897:      for a particular purpose;
 2898: 
 2899:      ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
 2900:      liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
 2901:      incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
 2902: 
 2903:      iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
 2904:      in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
 2905: 
 2906:      iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
 2907:      party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
 2908:      of this section 3.
 2909: 
 2910: 3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
 2911: 
 2912:   a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
 2913:   Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
 2914:   files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
 2915:   Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
 2916:   Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
 2917:   under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
 2918: 
 2919:   b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
 2920:   the Program.
 2921: 
 2922: 3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
 2923: trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
 2924: of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
 2925: the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
 2926: their own appropriate notices.
 2927: 
 2928: 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
 2929: 
 2930: Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
 2931: with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
 2932: license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
 2933: the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
 2934: offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
 2935: liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
 2936: the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
 2937: ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
 2938: other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
 2939: damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
 2940: and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
 2941: Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
 2942: Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
 2943: in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
 2944: apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
 2945: intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
 2946: Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
 2947: writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
 2948: and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
 2949: related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
 2950: participate in any such claim at its own expense.
 2951: 
 2952: For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
 2953: product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
 2954: Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
 2955: claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
 2956: claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
 2957: alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
 2958: defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
 2959: claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
 2960: pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
 2961: those damages.
 2962: 
 2963: 5. NO WARRANTY
 2964: 
 2965: EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
 2966: PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
 2967: BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
 2968: IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
 2969: TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 2970: PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
 2971: appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
 2972: risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
 2973: including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
 2974: compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
 2975: or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
 2976: 
 2977: 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
 2978: 
 2979: EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
 2980: PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
 2981: SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
 2982: EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
 2983: PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
 2984: CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
 2985: ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
 2986: EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
 2987: POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 2988: 
 2989: 7. GENERAL
 2990: 
 2991: If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
 2992: applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
 2993: the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
 2994: action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
 2995: minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
 2996: 
 2997: If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
 2998: (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
 2999: Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
 3000: or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
 3001: rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
 3002: litigation is filed.
 3003: 
 3004: All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
 3005: fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
 3006: Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
 3007: time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
 3008: rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
 3009: and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
 3010: However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
 3011: granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
 3012: 
 3013: Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
 3014: but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
 3015: may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
 3016: reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
 3017: this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
 3018: Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
 3019: is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
 3020: responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
 3021: entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
 3022: version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
 3023: Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
 3024: received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
 3025: Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
 3026: Contributions) under the new version.
 3027: 
 3028: Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
 3029: receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
 3030: Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
 3031: estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
 3032: under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
 3033: to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
 3034: No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

 3206: Legal Protection:
 3207: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names,

 3229: 
 3230: The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous

 3233: 
 3234: For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an вЂњas isвЂќ

 3261: obligations and/or services consistent with this Licence. However, in
 3262: accepting such obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your
 3263: sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other
 3264: Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each

 3375: 
 3376: This European Union Public Licence (the вЂEUPLвЂ™) applies to the Work (as
 3377: defined below) which is provided under the terms of this Licence. Any use of
 3378: the Work, other than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited (to the
 3379: extent such use is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the Work).
 3380: 
 3381: The Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as
 3382: defined below) has placed the following notice immediately following the
 3383: copyright notice for the Work: вЂњLicensed under the EUPLвЂќ, or has expressed by
 3384: any other means his willingness to license under the EUPL.
 3385: 
 3386: 1. Definitions

 3394:   вЂLicensee, based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This

 3430: вЂ” lend and rent the Work or copies thereof,
 3431: вЂ” sublicense rights in the Work or copies thereof.
 3432: 
 3433: Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now
 3434: known or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so.
 3435: 
 3436: In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to
 3437: exercise his moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make
 3438: effective the licence of the economic rights here above listed.
 3439: 
 3440: The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non-exclusive usage rights
 3441: to any patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of
 3442: the rights granted on the Work under this Licence.
 3443: 
 3444: 3. Communication of the Source Code
 3445: 
 3446: The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as

 3449: along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates,
 3450: in a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository
 3451: where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the
 3452: Licensor continues to distribute or communicate the Work.
 3453: 
 3454: 4. Limitations on copyright
 3455: 
 3456: Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits
 3457: from any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners
 3458: in the Work, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable
 3459: limitations thereto.
 3460: 
 3461: 5. Obligations of the Licensee
 3462: 
 3463: The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and
 3464: obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:
 3465: 
 3466: Attribution right: The Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or
 3467: trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the
 3468: disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and
 3469: a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes or
 3470: communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent
 3471: notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification.
 3472: 
 3473: Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes or communicates copies of the
 3474: Original Works or Derivative Works, this Distribution or Communication will be
 3475: done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence
 3476: unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under this version of
 3477: the Licence вЂ” for example by communicating вЂEUPL v. 1.2 onlyвЂ™. The Licensee
 3478: (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions
 3479: on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the
 3480: Licence.
 3481: 
 3482: Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes or Communicates Derivative
 3483: Works or copies thereof based upon both the Work and another work licensed
 3484: under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution or Communication can be done
 3485: under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause,
 3486: вЂCompatible LicenceвЂ™ refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to
 3487: this Licence. Should the Licensee's obligations under the Compatible Licence
 3488: conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the
 3489: Compatible Licence shall prevail.
 3490: 
 3491: Provision of Source Code: When distributing or communicating copies of the
 3492: Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or
 3493: indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available
 3494: for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute or communicate the Work.
 3495: 
 3496: Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade
 3497: names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required
 3498: for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
 3499: reproducing the content of the copyright notice.
 3500: 
 3501: 6. Chain of Authorship
 3502: 
 3503: The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted
 3504: hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the
 3505: power and authority to grant the Licence.
 3506: 
 3507: Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she
 3508: brings to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she
 3509: has the power and authority to grant the Licence.
 3510: 
 3511: Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent
 3512: Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the
 3513: terms of this Licence.
 3514: 
 3515: 7. Disclaimer of Warranty
 3516: 
 3517: The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous
 3518: Contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or
 3519: вЂbugsвЂ™ inherent to this type of development.
 3520: 
 3521: For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an вЂas isвЂ™
 3522: basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including
 3523: without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence
 3524: of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property
 3525: rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.
 3526: 
 3527: This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a
 3528: condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.
 3529: 
 3530: 8. Disclaimer of Liability
 3531: 
 3532: Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural
 3533: persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect,
 3534: material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the
 3535: use of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill,
 3536: work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial
 3537: damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such
 3538: damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability
 3539: laws as far such laws apply to the Work.
 3540: 
 3541: 9. Additional agreements
 3542: 
 3543: While distributing the Work, You may choose to conclude an additional
 3544: agreement, defining obligations or services consistent with this Licence.
 3545: However, if accepting obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on
 3546: your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other
 3547: Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
 3548: Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against
 3549: such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any warranty or additional
 3550: liability.
 3551: 
 3552: 10. Acceptance of the Licence

 3557: of applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable
 3558: acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions.
 3559: 
 3560: Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and

 3564: 
 3565: 11. Information to the public
 3566: 
 3567: In case of any Distribution or Communication of the Work by means of
 3568: electronic communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work
 3569: from a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a
 3570: website) must at least provide to the public the information requested by the
 3571: applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be
 3572: accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee.
 3573: 
 3574: 12. Termination of the Licence
 3575: 
 3576: The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon
 3577: any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence. Such a termination
 3578: will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the Work from
 3579: the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full
 3580: compliance with the Licence.
 3581: 
 3582: 13. Miscellaneous
 3583: 
 3584: Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete

 3586: 
 3587: If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable

 3589: whole. Such provision will be construed or reformed so as necessary to make it
 3590: valid and enforceable.
 3591: 
 3592: The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions or new versions
 3593: of this Licence or updated versions of the Appendix, so far this is required
 3594: and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the

 3596: number.
 3597: 
 3598: All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission,
 3599: have identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of
 3600: their choice.
 3601: 
 3602: 14. Jurisdiction
 3603: 
 3604: Without prejudice to specific agreement between parties,
 3605: вЂ” any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising

 3607:   Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court
 3608:   of Justice of the European Union, as laid down in article 272 of the Treaty
 3609:   on the Functioning of the European Union,
 3610: вЂ” any litigation arising between other parties and resulting from the
 3611:   interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive

 3650: GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 3651:                        Version 2, June 1991
 3652: 
 3653:  Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 3654:  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 3655:  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 3656:  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 3657: 
 3658:                             Preamble
 3659: 
 3660:   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 3661: freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
 3662: License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
 3663: software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
 3664: General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
 3665: Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
 3666: using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
 3667: the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
 3668: your programs, too.
 3669: 
 3670:   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 3671: price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 3672: have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 3673: this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
 3674: if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
 3675: in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
 3676: 
 3677:   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 3678: anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
 3679: These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
 3680: distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
 3681: 
 3682:   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
 3683: gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
 3684: you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
 3685: source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
 3686: rights.
 3687: 
 3688:   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
 3689: (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
 3690: distribute and/or modify the software.
 3691: 
 3692:   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
 3693: that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
 3694: software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
 3695: want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
 3696: that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
 3697: authors' reputations.
 3698: 
 3699:   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
 3700: patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
 3701: program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
 3702: program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
 3703: patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
 3704: 
 3705:   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 3706: modification follow.
 3707: 
 3708:                     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 3709:    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 3710: 
 3711:   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
 3712: a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
 3713: under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
 3714: refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
 3715: means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
 3716: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
 3717: either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
 3718: language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
 3719: the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
 3720: 
 3721: Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 3722: covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
 3723: running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
 3724: is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
 3725: Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
 3726: Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
 3727: 
 3728:   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
 3729: source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
 3730: conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
 3731: copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
 3732: notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
 3733: and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
 3734: along with the Program.
 3735: 
 3736: You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
 3737: you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
 3738: 
 3739:   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
 3740: of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
 3741: distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 3742: above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 3743: 
 3744:     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
 3745:     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 3746: 
 3747:     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
 3748:     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
 3749:     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
 3750:     parties under the terms of this License.
 3751: 
 3752:     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
 3753:     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
 3754:     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
 3755:     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
 3756:     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
 3757:     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
 3758:     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
 3759:     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
 3760:     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
 3761:     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
 3762: 
 3763: These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
 3764: identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
 3765: and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
 3766: themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
 3767: sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
 3768: distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
 3769: on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
 3770: this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
 3771: entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
 3772: 
 3773: Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
 3774: your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
 3775: exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
 3776: collective works based on the Program.
 3777: 
 3778: In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
 3779: with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
 3780: a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
 3781: the scope of this License.
 3782: 
 3783:   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
 3784: under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
 3785: Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
 3786: 
 3787:     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
 3788:     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
 3789:     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
 3790: 
 3791:     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
 3792:     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
 3793:     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
 3794:     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
 3795:     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
 3796:     customarily used for software interchange; or,
 3797: 
 3798:     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
 3799:     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
 3800:     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
 3801:     received the program in object code or executable form with such
 3802:     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
 3803: 
 3804: The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 3805: making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
 3806: code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
 3807: associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
 3808: control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
 3809: special exception, the source code distributed need not include
 3810: anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
 3811: form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
 3812: operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
 3813: itself accompanies the executable.
 3814: 
 3815: If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
 3816: access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
 3817: access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
 3818: distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
 3819: compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
 3820: 
 3821:   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
 3822: except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
 3823: otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
 3824: void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
 3825: However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
 3826: this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
 3827: parties remain in full compliance.
 3828: 
 3829:   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
 3830: signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
 3831: distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
 3832: prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
 3833: modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
 3834: Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
 3835: all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
 3836: the Program or works based on it.
 3837: 
 3838:   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
 3839: Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
 3840: original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
 3841: these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
 3842: restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
 3843: You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
 3844: this License.
 3845: 
 3846:   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 3847: infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
 3848: conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 3849: otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 3850: excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
 3851: distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 3852: License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
 3853: may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
 3854: license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
 3855: all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
 3856: the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 3857: refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
 3858: 
 3859: If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
 3860: any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
 3861: apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
 3862: circumstances.
 3863: 
 3864: It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
 3865: patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
 3866: such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
 3867: integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
 3868: implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
 3869: generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
 3870: through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
 3871: system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
 3872: to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
 3873: impose that choice.
 3874: 
 3875: This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
 3876: be a consequence of the rest of this License.
 3877: 
 3878:   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
 3879: certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
 3880: original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
 3881: may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
 3882: those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
 3883: countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
 3884: the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
 3885: 
 3886:   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
 3887: of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
 3888: be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
 3889: address new problems or concerns.
 3890: 
 3891: Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
 3892: specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
 3893: later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
 3894: either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
 3895: Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
 3896: this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
 3897: Foundation.
 3898: 
 3899:   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
 3900: programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
 3901: to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
 3902: Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
 3903: make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
 3904: of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
 3905: of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
 3906: 
 3907:                             NO WARRANTY
 3908: 
 3909:   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
 3910: FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
 3911: OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
 3912: PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
 3913: OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
 3914: MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
 3915: TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
 3916: PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
 3917: REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 3918: 
 3919:   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
 3920: WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
 3921: REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
 3922: INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
 3923: OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
 3924: TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
 3925: YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
 3926: PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
 3927: POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 3928: 
 3929:                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 3930: 
 3931:             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
 3932: 
 3933:   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
 3934: possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
 3935: free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
 3936: 
 3937:   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
 3938: to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 3939: convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
 3940: the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 3941: 
 3942:     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
 3943:     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
 3944: 
 3945:     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
 3946:     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
 3947:     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
 3948:     (at your option) any later version.
 3949: 
 3950:     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 3951:     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
 3952:     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
 3953:     GNU General Public License for more details.
 3954: 
 3955:     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
 3956:     with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 3957:     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
 3958: 
 3959: Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 3960: 
 3961: If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
 3962: when it starts in an interactive mode:
 3963: 
 3964:     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
 3965:     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
 3966:     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
 3967:     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
 3968: 
 3969: The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
 3970: parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
 3971: be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
 3972: mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
 3973: 
 3974: You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
 3975: school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
 3976: necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
 3977: 
 3978:   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
 3979:   `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

 3984: This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
 3985: proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
 3986: consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
 3987: library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
 3988: Public License instead of this License.

 3994: GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 3995:                        Version 3, 29 June 2007
 3996: 
 3997:  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 3998:  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 3999:  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 4000: 
 4001:                             Preamble
 4002: 
 4003:   The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 4004: software and other kinds of works.
 4005: 
 4006:   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 4007: to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
 4008: the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
 4009: share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
 4010: software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
 4011: GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
 4012: any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
 4013: your programs, too.
 4014: 
 4015:   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 4016: price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 4017: have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 4018: them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
 4019: want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
 4020: free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
 4021: 
 4022:   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
 4023: these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
 4024: certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
 4025: you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
 4026: 
 4027:   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
 4028: gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
 4029: freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
 4030: or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
 4031: know their rights.
 4032: 
 4033:   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
 4034: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
 4035: giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
 4036: 
 4037:   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
 4038: that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
 4039: authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
 4040: changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
 4041: authors of previous versions.
 4042: 
 4043:   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
 4044: modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
 4045: can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
 4046: protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
 4047: pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
 4048: use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
 4049: have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
 4050: products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
 4051: stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
 4052: of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
 4053: 
 4054:   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
 4055: States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
 4056: software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
 4057: avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
 4058: make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
 4059: patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
 4060: 
 4061:   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 4062: modification follow.
 4063: 
 4064:                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 4065: 
 4066:   0. Definitions.
 4067: 
 4068:   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
 4069: 
 4070:   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
 4071: works, such as semiconductor masks.
 4072: 
 4073:   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
 4074: License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
 4075: "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
 4076: 
 4077:   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
 4078: in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
 4079: exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
 4080: earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
 4081: 
 4082:   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
 4083: on the Program.
 4084: 
 4085:   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
 4086: permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
 4087: infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
 4088: computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
 4089: distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
 4090: public, and in some countries other activities as well.
 4091: 
 4092:   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
 4093: parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
 4094: a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
 4095: 
 4096:   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
 4097: to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
 4098: feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
 4099: tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
 4100: extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
 4101: work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
 4102: the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
 4103: menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
 4104: 
 4105:   1. Source Code.
 4106: 
 4107:   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
 4108: for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
 4109: form of a work.
 4110: 
 4111:   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
 4112: standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
 4113: interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
 4114: is widely used among developers working in that language.
 4115: 
 4116:   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
 4117: than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
 4118: packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
 4119: Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
 4120: Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
 4121: implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
 4122: "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
 4123: (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
 4124: (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
 4125: produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
 4126: 
 4127:   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
 4128: the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
 4129: work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
 4130: control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
 4131: System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
 4132: programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
 4133: which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
 4134: includes interface definition files associated with source files for
 4135: the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
 4136: linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
 4137: such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
 4138: subprograms and other parts of the work.
 4139: 
 4140:   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
 4141: can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
 4142: Source.
 4143: 
 4144:   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
 4145: same work.
 4146: 
 4147:   2. Basic Permissions.
 4148: 
 4149:   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
 4150: copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
 4151: conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
 4152: permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
 4153: covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
 4154: content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
 4155: rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
 4156: 
 4157:   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
 4158: convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
 4159: in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
 4160: of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
 4161: with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
 4162: the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
 4163: not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
 4164: for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
 4165: and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
 4166: your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
 4167: 
 4168:   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
 4169: the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
 4170: makes it unnecessary.
 4171: 
 4172:   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
 4173: 
 4174:   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
 4175: measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
 4176: 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
 4177: similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
 4178: measures.
 4179: 
 4180:   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
 4181: circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
 4182: is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
 4183: the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
 4184: modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
 4185: users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
 4186: technological measures.
 4187: 
 4188:   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
 4189: 
 4190:   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
 4191: receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
 4192: appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
 4193: keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
 4194: non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
 4195: keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
 4196: recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
 4197: 
 4198:   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
 4199: and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
 4200: 
 4201:   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
 4202: 
 4203:   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
 4204: produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
 4205: terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 4206: 
 4207:     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
 4208:     it, and giving a relevant date.
 4209: 
 4210:     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
 4211:     released under this License and any conditions added under section
 4212:     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
 4213:     "keep intact all notices".
 4214: 
 4215:     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
 4216:     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
 4217:     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
 4218:     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
 4219:     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
 4220:     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
 4221:     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
 4222: 
 4223:     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
 4224:     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
 4225:     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
 4226:     work need not make them do so.
 4227: 
 4228:   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
 4229: works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
 4230: and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
 4231: in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
 4232: "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
 4233: used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
 4234: beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
 4235: in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
 4236: parts of the aggregate.
 4237: 
 4238:   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
 4239: 
 4240:   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
 4241: of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
 4242: machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
 4243: in one of these ways:
 4244: 
 4245:     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
 4246:     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
 4247:     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
 4248:     customarily used for software interchange.
 4249: 
 4250:     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
 4251:     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
 4252:     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
 4253:     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
 4254:     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
 4255:     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
 4256:     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
 4257:     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
 4258:     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
 4259:     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
 4260:     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
 4261: 
 4262:     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
 4263:     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
 4264:     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
 4265:     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
 4266:     with subsection 6b.
 4267: 
 4268:     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
 4269:     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
 4270:     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
 4271:     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
 4272:     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
 4273:     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
 4274:     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
 4275:     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
 4276:     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
 4277:     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
 4278:     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
 4279:     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
 4280: 
 4281:     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
 4282:     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
 4283:     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
 4284:     charge under subsection 6d.
 4285: 
 4286:   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
 4287: from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
 4288: included in conveying the object code work.
 4289: 
 4290:   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
 4291: tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
 4292: or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
 4293: into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
 4294: doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
 4295: product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
 4296: typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
 4297: of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
 4298: actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
 4299: is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
 4300: commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
 4301: the only significant mode of use of the product.
 4302: 
 4303:   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
 4304: procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
 4305: and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
 4306: a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
 4307: suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
 4308: code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
 4309: modification has been made.
 4310: 
 4311:   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
 4312: specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
 4313: part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
 4314: User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
 4315: fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
 4316: Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
 4317: by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
 4318: if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
 4319: modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
 4320: been installed in ROM).
 4321: 
 4322:   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
 4323: requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
 4324: for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
 4325: the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
 4326: network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
 4327: adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
 4328: protocols for communication across the network.
 4329: 
 4330:   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
 4331: in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
 4332: documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
 4333: source code form), and must require no special password or key for
 4334: unpacking, reading or copying.
 4335: 
 4336:   7. Additional Terms.
 4337: 
 4338:   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
 4339: License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
 4340: Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
 4341: be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
 4342: that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
 4343: apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
 4344: under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
 4345: this License without regard to the additional permissions.
 4346: 
 4347:   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
 4348: remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
 4349: it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
 4350: removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
 4351: additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
 4352: for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
 4353: 
 4354:   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
 4355: add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
 4356: that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
 4357: 
 4358:     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
 4359:     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
 4360: 
 4361:     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
 4362:     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
 4363:     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
 4364: 
 4365:     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
 4366:     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
 4367:     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
 4368: 
 4369:     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
 4370:     authors of the material; or
 4371: 
 4372:     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
 4373:     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
 4374: 
 4375:     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
 4376:     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
 4377:     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
 4378:     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
 4379:     those licensors and authors.
 4380: 
 4381:   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
 4382: restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
 4383: received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
 4384: governed by this License along with a term that is a further
 4385: restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
 4386: a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
 4387: License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
 4388: of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
 4389: not survive such relicensing or conveying.
 4390: 
 4391:   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
 4392: must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
 4393: additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
 4394: where to find the applicable terms.
 4395: 
 4396:   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
 4397: form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
 4398: the above requirements apply either way.
 4399: 
 4400:   8. Termination.
 4401: 
 4402:   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
 4403: provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
 4404: modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
 4405: this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
 4406: paragraph of section 11).
 4407: 
 4408:   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
 4409: license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
 4410: provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
 4411: finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
 4412: holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
 4413: prior to 60 days after the cessation.
 4414: 
 4415:   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
 4416: reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
 4417: violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
 4418: received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
 4419: copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
 4420: your receipt of the notice.
 4421: 
 4422:   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
 4423: licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
 4424: this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
 4425: reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
 4426: material under section 10.
 4427: 
 4428:   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
 4429: 
 4430:   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
 4431: run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
 4432: occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
 4433: to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
 4434: nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
 4435: modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
 4436: not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
 4437: covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
 4438: 
 4439:   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
 4440: 
 4441:   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
 4442: receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
 4443: propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
 4444: for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
 4445: 
 4446:   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
 4447: organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
 4448: organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
 4449: work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
 4450: transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
 4451: licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
 4452: give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
 4453: Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
 4454: the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
 4455: 
 4456:   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
 4457: rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
 4458: not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
 4459: rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
 4460: (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
 4461: any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
 4462: sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
 4463: 
 4464:   11. Patents.
 4465: 
 4466:   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
 4467: License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
 4468: work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
 4469: 
 4470:   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
 4471: owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
 4472: hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
 4473: by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
 4474: but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
 4475: consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
 4476: purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
 4477: patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
 4478: this License.
 4479: 
 4480:   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
 4481: patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
 4482: make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
 4483: propagate the contents of its contributor version.
 4484: 
 4485:   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
 4486: agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
 4487: (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
 4488: sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
 4489: party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
 4490: patent against the party.
 4491: 
 4492:   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
 4493: and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
 4494: to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
 4495: publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
 4496: then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
 4497: available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
 4498: patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
 4499: consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
 4500: license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
 4501: actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
 4502: covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
 4503: in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
 4504: country that you have reason to believe are valid.
 4505: 
 4506:   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
 4507: arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
 4508: covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
 4509: receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
 4510: or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
 4511: you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
 4512: work and works based on it.
 4513: 
 4514:   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
 4515: the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
 4516: conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
 4517: specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
 4518: work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
 4519: in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
 4520: to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
 4521: the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
 4522: parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
 4523: patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
 4524: conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
 4525: for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
 4526: contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
 4527: or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
 4528: 
 4529:   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
 4530: any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
 4531: otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
 4532: 
 4533:   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
 4534: 
 4535:   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 4536: otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 4537: excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
 4538: covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 4539: License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
 4540: not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
 4541: to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
 4542: the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
 4543: License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
 4544: 
 4545:   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
 4546: 
 4547:   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
 4548: permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
 4549: under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
 4550: combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
 4551: License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
 4552: but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
 4553: section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
 4554: combination as such.
 4555: 
 4556:   14. Revised Versions of this License.
 4557: 
 4558:   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
 4559: the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
 4560: be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
 4561: address new problems or concerns.
 4562: 
 4563:   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
 4564: Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
 4565: Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
 4566: option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
 4567: version or of any later version published by the Free Software
 4568: Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
 4569: GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
 4570: by the Free Software Foundation.
 4571: 
 4572:   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
 4573: versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
 4574: public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
 4575: to choose that version for the Program.
 4576: 
 4577:   Later license versions may give you additional or different
 4578: permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
 4579: author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
 4580: later version.
 4581: 
 4582:   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
 4583: 
 4584:   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
 4585: APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
 4586: HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
 4587: OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
 4588: THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 4589: PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
 4590: IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
 4591: ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 4592: 
 4593:   16. Limitation of Liability.
 4594: 
 4595:   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
 4596: WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
 4597: THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
 4598: GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
 4599: USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
 4600: DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
 4601: PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
 4602: EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
 4603: SUCH DAMAGES.
 4604: 
 4605:   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
 4606: 
 4607:   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
 4608: above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
 4609: reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
 4610: an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
 4611: Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
 4612: copy of the Program in return for a fee.
 4613: 
 4614:                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 4615: 
 4616:             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
 4617: 
 4618:   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
 4619: possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
 4620: free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
 4621: 
 4622:   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
 4623: to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 4624: state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
 4625: the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

 4696:  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 4697:  51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 4698:  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 4699:  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 4700: 
 4701: [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 4702:  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 4703:  the version number 2.1.]
 4704: 
 4705:                             Preamble
 4706: 
 4707:   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 4708: freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
 4709: Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
 4710: free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
 4711: 
 4712:   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
 4713: specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
 4714: Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
 4715: can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
 4716: this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
 4717: strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
 4718: 
 4719:   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
 4720: not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
 4721: you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
 4722: for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
 4723: it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
 4724: it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
 4725: these things.
 4726: 
 4727:   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 4728: distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
 4729: rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
 4730: you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
 4731: 
 4732:   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
 4733: or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
 4734: you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
 4735: code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
 4736: complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
 4737: with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
 4738: it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
 4739: 
 4740:   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
 4741: library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
 4742: permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
 4743: 
 4744:   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
 4745: there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
 4746: modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
 4747: that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
 4748: author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
 4749: introduced by others.
 4750: 
 4751:   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
 4752: any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
 4753: effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
 4754: restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
 4755: any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
 4756: consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
 4757: 
 4758:   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
 4759: ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
 4760: General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
 4761: is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
 4762: this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
 4763: libraries into non-free programs.
 4764: 
 4765:   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
 4766: a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
 4767: combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
 4768: General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
 4769: entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
 4770: Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
 4771: the library.
 4772: 
 4773:   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
 4774: does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
 4775: Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
 4776: of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
 4777: are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
 4778: libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
 4779: special circumstances.
 4780: 
 4781:   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
 4782: encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
 4783: a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
 4784: allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
 4785: library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
 4786: case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
 4787: software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
 4788: 
 4789:   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
 4790: programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
 4791: free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
 4792: non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
 4793: operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
 4794: system.
 4795: 
 4796:   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
 4797: users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
 4798: linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
 4799: that program using a modified version of the Library.
 4800: 
 4801:   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 4802: modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
 4803: "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
 4804: former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
 4805: be combined with the library in order to run.
 4806: 
 4807:                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 4808:    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 4809: 
 4810:   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
 4811: program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
 4812: other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
 4813: this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
 4814: Each licensee is addressed as "you".
 4815: 
 4816:   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
 4817: prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
 4818: (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
 4819: 
 4820:   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
 4821: which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
 4822: Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
 4823: copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
 4824: portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
 4825: straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
 4826: included without limitation in the term "modification".)
 4827: 
 4828:   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 4829: making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
 4830: all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
 4831: interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
 4832: and installation of the library.
 4833: 
 4834:   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 4835: covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
 4836: running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
 4837: such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
 4838: on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
 4839: writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
 4840: and what the program that uses the Library does.
 4841: 
 4842:   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
 4843: complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
 4844: you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
 4845: appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
 4846: all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
 4847: warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
 4848: Library.
 4849: 
 4850:   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
 4851: and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
 4852: fee.
 4853: 
 4854:   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
 4855: of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
 4856: distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 4857: above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 4858: 
 4859:     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
 4860: 
 4861:     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
 4862:     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 4863: 
 4864:     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
 4865:     charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
 4866: 
 4867:     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
 4868:     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
 4869:     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
 4870:     is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
 4871:     in the event an application does not supply such function or
 4872:     table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
 4873:     its purpose remains meaningful.
 4874: 
 4875:     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
 4876:     a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
 4877:     application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
 4878:     application-supplied function or table used by this function must
 4879:     be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
 4880:     root function must still compute square roots.)
 4881: 
 4882: These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
 4883: identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
 4884: and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
 4885: themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
 4886: sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
 4887: distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
 4888: on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
 4889: this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
 4890: entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
 4891: it.
 4892: 
 4893: Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
 4894: your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
 4895: exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
 4896: collective works based on the Library.
 4897: 
 4898: In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
 4899: with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
 4900: a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
 4901: the scope of this License.
 4902: 
 4903:   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
 4904: License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
 4905: this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
 4906: that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
 4907: instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
 4908: ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
 4909: that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
 4910: these notices.
 4911: 
 4912:   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
 4913: that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
 4914: subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
 4915: 
 4916:   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
 4917: the Library into a program that is not a library.
 4918: 
 4919:   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
 4920: derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
 4921: under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
 4922: it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
 4923: must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
 4924: medium customarily used for software interchange.
 4925: 
 4926:   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
 4927: from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
 4928: source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
 4929: distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
 4930: compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
 4931: 
 4932:   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
 4933: Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
 4934: linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
 4935: work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
 4936: therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
 4937: 
 4938:   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
 4939: creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
 4940: contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
 4941: library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
 4942: Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
 4943: 
 4944:   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
 4945: that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
 4946: derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
 4947: Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
 4948: linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
 4949: threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
 4950: 
 4951:   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
 4952: structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
 4953: functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
 4954: file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
 4955: work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
 4956: Library will still fall under Section 6.)
 4957: 
 4958:   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
 4959: distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
 4960: Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
 4961: whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
 4962: 
 4963:   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
 4964: link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
 4965: work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
 4966: under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
 4967: modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
 4968: engineering for debugging such modifications.
 4969: 
 4970:   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
 4971: Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
 4972: this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
 4973: during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
 4974: copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
 4975: directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
 4976: of these things:
 4977: 
 4978:     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
 4979:     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
 4980:     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
 4981:     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
 4982:     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
 4983:     uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
 4984:     user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
 4985:     executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
 4986:     that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
 4987:     Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
 4988:     to use the modified definitions.)
 4989: 
 4990:     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
 4991:     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
 4992:     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
 4993:     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
 4994:     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
 4995:     the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
 4996:     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
 4997: 
 4998:     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
 4999:     least three years, to give the same user the materials
 5000:     specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
 5001:     than the cost of performing this distribution.
 5002: 
 5003:     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
 5004:     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
 5005:     specified materials from the same place.
 5006: 
 5007:     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
 5008:     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
 5009: 
 5010:   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
 5011: Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
 5012: reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
 5013: the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
 5014: normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
 5015: components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
 5016: which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
 5017: the executable.
 5018: 
 5019:   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
 5020: restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
 5021: accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
 5022: use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
 5023: distribute.
 5024: 
 5025:   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
 5026: Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
 5027: facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
 5028: library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
 5029: the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
 5030: permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
 5031: 
 5032:     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
 5033:     based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
 5034:     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
 5035:     Sections above.
 5036: 
 5037:     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
 5038:     that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
 5039:     where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
 5040: 
 5041:   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
 5042: the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
 5043: attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
 5044: distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
 5045: rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
 5046: or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
 5047: terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 5048: 
 5049:   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
 5050: signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
 5051: distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
 5052: prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
 5053: modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
 5054: Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
 5055: all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
 5056: the Library or works based on it.
 5057: 
 5058:   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
 5059: Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
 5060: original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
 5061: subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
 5062: restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
 5063: You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
 5064: this License.
 5065: 
 5066:   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 5067: infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
 5068: conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 5069: otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 5070: excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
 5071: distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 5072: License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
 5073: may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
 5074: license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
 5075: all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
 5076: the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 5077: refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
 5078: 
 5079: If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
 5080: particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
 5081: and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
 5082: 
 5083: It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
 5084: patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
 5085: such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
 5086: integrity of the free software distribution system which is
 5087: implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
 5088: generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
 5089: through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
 5090: system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
 5091: to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
 5092: impose that choice.
 5093: 
 5094: This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
 5095: be a consequence of the rest of this License.
 5096: 
 5097:   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
 5098: certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
 5099: original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
 5100: an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
 5101: so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
 5102: excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
 5103: written in the body of this License.
 5104: 
 5105:   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
 5106: versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
 5107: Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
 5108: but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
 5109: 
 5110: Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
 5111: specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
 5112: "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
 5113: conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
 5114: the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
 5115: license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
 5116: the Free Software Foundation.
 5117: 
 5118:   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
 5119: programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
 5120: write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
 5121: copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
 5122: Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
 5123: decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
 5124: of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
 5125: and reuse of software generally.
 5126: 
 5127:                             NO WARRANTY
 5128: 
 5129:   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
 5130: WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
 5131: EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
 5132: OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
 5133: KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
 5134: IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 5135: PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
 5136: LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
 5137: THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 5138: 
 5139:   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
 5140: WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
 5141: AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
 5142: FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
 5143: CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
 5144: LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
 5145: RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
 5146: FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
 5147: SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 5148: DAMAGES.
 5149: 
 5150:                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 5151: 
 5152:            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
 5153: 
 5154:   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
 5155: possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
 5156: everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
 5157: redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
 5158: ordinary General Public License).
 5159: 
 5160:   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
 5161: safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 5162: convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
 5163: "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 5164: 
 5165:     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
 5166:     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
 5167: 
 5168:     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
 5169:     modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
 5170:     License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
 5171:     version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
 5172: 
 5173:     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 5174:     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
 5175:     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
 5176:     Lesser General Public License for more details.
 5177: 
 5178:     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
 5179:     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
 5180:     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301
 5181:     USA
 5182: 
 5183: Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 5184: 
 5185: You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
 5186: school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
 5187: necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

 5202: GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 5203:                        Version 3, 29 June 2007
 5204: 
 5205:  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 5206:  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 5207:  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 5208: 
 5209: 
 5210:   This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
 5211: the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
 5212: License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
 5213: 
 5214:   0. Additional Definitions.
 5215: 
 5216:   As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
 5217: General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
 5218: General Public License.
 5219: 
 5220:   "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
 5221: other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
 5222: 
 5223:   An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
 5224: by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
 5225: Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
 5226: of using an interface provided by the Library.
 5227: 
 5228:   A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
 5229: Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
 5230: with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
 5231: Version".
 5232: 
 5233:   The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
 5234: Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
 5235: for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
 5236: based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
 5237: 
 5238:   The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
 5239: object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
 5240: and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
 5241: Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
 5242: 
 5243:   1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
 5244: 
 5245:   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
 5246: without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
 5247: 
 5248:   2. Conveying Modified Versions.
 5249: 
 5250:   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
 5251: facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
 5252: that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
 5253: facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
 5254: version:
 5255: 
 5256:    a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
 5257:    ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
 5258:    function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
 5259:    whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
 5260: 
 5261:    b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
 5262:    this License applicable to that copy.
 5263: 
 5264:   3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
 5265: 
 5266:   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
 5267: a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
 5268: code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
 5269: material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
 5270: layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
 5271: (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
 5272: 
 5273:    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
 5274:    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
 5275:    covered by this License.
 5276: 
 5277:    b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
 5278:    document.
 5279: 
 5280:   4. Combined Works.
 5281: 
 5282:   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
 5283: taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
 5284: portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
 5285: engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
 5286: the following:
 5287: 
 5288:    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
 5289:    the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
 5290:    covered by this License.
 5291: 
 5292:    b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
 5293:    document.
 5294: 
 5295:    c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
 5296:    execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
 5297:    these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
 5298:    copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
 5299: 
 5300:    d) Do one of the following:
 5301: 
 5302:        0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
 5303:        License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
 5304:        suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
 5305:        recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
 5306:        the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
 5307:        manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
 5308:        Corresponding Source.
 5309: 
 5310:        1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
 5311:        Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
 5312:        a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
 5313:        system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
 5314:        of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
 5315:        Version.
 5316: 
 5317:    e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
 5318:    be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
 5319:    GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
 5320:    necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
 5321:    Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
 5322:    Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
 5323:    you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
 5324:    the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
 5325:    Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
 5326:    Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
 5327:    for conveying Corresponding Source.)
 5328: 
 5329:   5. Combined Libraries.
 5330: 
 5331:   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
 5332: Library side by side in a single library together with other library
 5333: facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
 5334: License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
 5335: choice, if you do both of the following:
 5336: 
 5337:    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
 5338:    on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
 5339:    conveyed under the terms of this License.
 5340: 
 5341:    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
 5342:    is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
 5343:    accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
 5344: 
 5345:   6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
 5346: 
 5347:   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
 5348: of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
 5349: versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
 5350: differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
 5351: 
 5352:   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
 5353: Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
 5354: of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
 5355: applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
 5356: conditions either of that published version or of any later version
 5357: published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
 5358: received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
 5359: General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
 5360: General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
 5361: 
 5362:   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
 5363: whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
 5364: apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
 5365: permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
 5366: Library.

 5383: ========
 5384: 
 5385: The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the primary license under
 5386: which the LaTeX kernel and the base LaTeX packages are distributed.
 5387: 
 5388: You may use this license for any work of which you hold the copyright
 5389: and which you wish to distribute.  This license may be particularly
 5390: suitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but
 5391: it is written in such a way that you can use it even if your work is
 5392: unrelated to TeX.
 5393: 
 5394: The section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE',
 5395: below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors
 5396: who are considering distributing their works under this license.
 5397: 
 5398: This license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed
 5399: and modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of
 5400: that work may be distributed.
 5401: 
 5402: We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you
 5403: the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work
 5404: that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while
 5405: maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of
 5406: that work.  If you do not see how to achieve your goal while
 5407: meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex'

 5410: 
 5411: DEFINITIONS
 5412: ===========
 5413: 
 5414: In this license document the following terms are used:
 5415: 
 5416:    `Work'
 5417:     Any work being distributed under this License.
 5418: 
 5419:    `Derived Work'
 5420:     Any work that under any applicable law is derived from the Work.
 5421: 
 5422:    `Modification'
 5423:     Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable
 5424:     law -- for example, the production of a file containing an
 5425:     original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of
 5426:     such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
 5427:     translated into another language.
 5428: 
 5429:    `Modify'
 5430:     To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any
 5431:     applicable law.
 5432: 
 5433:    `Distribution'
 5434:     Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in
 5435:     whole or in part.  Distribution includes (but is not limited to)
 5436:     making any electronic components of the Work accessible by
 5437:     file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file
 5438:     systems such as Sun's Network File System (NFS).
 5439: 
 5440:    `Compiled Work'
 5441:     A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it
 5442:     is directly usable on a computer system.  This processing may
 5443:     include using installation facilities provided by the Work,
 5444:     transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or
 5445:     other activities.  Note that modification of any installation
 5446:     facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work.
 5447: 
 5448:    `Current Maintainer'
 5449:     A person or persons nominated as such within the Work.  If there is
 5450:     no such explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder' under
 5451:     any applicable law.
 5452: 
 5453:    `Base Interpreter'
 5454:     A program or process that is normally needed for running or
 5455:     interpreting a part or the whole of the Work.
 5456: 
 5457:     A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these
 5458:     are not considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each
 5459:     external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used
 5460:     interactively.  Unless explicitly specified when applying the
 5461:     license to the Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a
 5462:     `LaTeX-Format' or in the case of files belonging to the
 5463:     `LaTeX-format' a program implementing the `TeX language'.

 5466: 
 5467: CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 5468: ===========================================
 5469: 
 5470: 1.  Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work
 5471: are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope.  In
 5472: particular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no
 5473: requirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work.
 5474: 
 5475: 2.  You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you
 5476: received it.  Distribution of only part of the Work is considered
 5477: modification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived
 5478: Work may be assumed under the terms of this clause.
 5479: 
 5480: 3.  You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a
 5481: complete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2
 5482: above, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that
 5483: the recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly
 5484: as it would have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work
 5485: directly from the Work.
 5486: 
 5487: 4.  If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without
 5488: restriction, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work.  You may
 5489: also distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including
 5490: Compiled Works generated from the Derived Work.  Derived Works
 5491: distributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer are considered to
 5492: be updated versions of the Work.
 5493: 
 5494: 5.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify
 5495: your copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work,
 5496: and compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on
 5497: the Derived Work.
 5498: 
 5499: 6.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may
 5500: distribute a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met
 5501: for every component of the Work unless that component clearly states
 5502: in the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition.  Only
 5503: the Current Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption
 5504: to a component of the Work.
 5505: 
 5506:   a. If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement
 5507:      for a component of the Work when that component is used with the
 5508:      Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work
 5509:      identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that
 5510:      Base Interpreter, the replacement component of this Derived Work
 5511:      clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version
 5512:      of this component to the user when used interactively with that
 5513:      Base Interpreter.
 5514: 
 5515:   b. Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices
 5516:      detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a
 5517:      prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part
 5518:      of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log
 5519:      of the changes.
 5520: 
 5521:   c. No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons,
 5522:      including (but not limited to) the authors of the original version
 5523:      of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to)
 5524:      the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the
 5525:      Derived Work unless those persons have stated explicitly that
 5526:      they do provide such support for the Derived Work.
 5527: 
 5528:   d. You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:
 5529: 
 5530:        1. A complete, unmodified copy of the Work;
 5531:           if your distribution of a modified component is made by
 5532:           offering access to copy the modified component from a
 5533:           designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
 5534:           the Work from the same or some similar place meets this
 5535:           condition, even though third parties are not compelled to
 5536:           copy the Work along with the modified component;
 5537: 
 5538:        2. Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete,
 5539:           unmodified copy of the Work.
 5540: 
 5541: 7.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may
 5542: distribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as
 5543: the Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled
 5544: Work, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with
 5545: regard to the Derived Work.
 5546: 
 5547: 8.  The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not
 5548: apply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it
 5549: becomes identical to an updated version of that component of the Work as
 5550: it is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.
 5551: 
 5552: 9.  Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative
 5553: format, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is
 5554: then produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or
 5555: nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of
 5556: applying that process.
 5557: 
 5558: 10. a. A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license
 5559:        provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in
 5560:        Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have
 5561:        to honor the rest of the conditions in this license.
 5562: 
 5563:     b. If a Derived Work is distributed under a different license, that
 5564:        Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of
 5565:        itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the
 5566:        restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.
 5567: 
 5568: 11. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to
 5569: the Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating
 5570: such works with the Work by any means.
 5571: 
 5572: 12.  Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent
 5573: complete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws.
 5574: 
 5575: 
 5576: NO WARRANTY
 5577: ===========
 5578: 
 5579: There is no warranty for the Work.  Except when otherwise stated in
 5580: writing, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is', without
 5581: warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not
 5582: limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a
 5583: particular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance
 5584: of the Work is with you.  Should the Work prove defective, you assume
 5585: the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.
 5586: 
 5587: In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing
 5588: will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components of the
 5589: Work, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify the Work as
 5590: permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general,
 5591: special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of
 5592: the Work or out of inability to use the Work (including, but not limited
 5593: to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by
 5594: anyone as a result of any failure of the Work to operate with any other
 5595: programs), even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said other
 5596: party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 5597: 
 5598: 
 5599: MAINTENANCE OF THE WORK
 5600: =======================
 5601: 
 5602: The Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder
 5603: explicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in
 5604: the Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder
 5605: or simply that it is `author-maintained'.
 5606: 
 5607: The Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer
 5608: who has indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error
 5609: reports for the Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail
 5610: address). It is not required for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge
 5611: or act upon these error reports.
 5612: 
 5613: The Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there
 5614: is no Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current
 5615: Maintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means
 5616: of communication for a period of six months, and there are no other
 5617: significant signs of active maintenance.
 5618: 
 5619: You can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with
 5620: any existing Current Maintainer to take over this role.
 5621: 
 5622: If the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of
 5623: the Work through the following steps:
 5624: 
 5625:  1.  Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and
 5626:      the Copyright Holder, if the two differ) through the means of
 5627:      an Internet or similar search.
 5628: 
 5629:  2.  If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work
 5630:      is still maintained.
 5631: 
 5632:   a. If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer
 5633:      to update their communication data within one month.
 5634: 
 5635:   b. If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active
 5636:      maintenance is taken by the Current Maintainer, then announce
 5637:      within the pertinent community your intention to take over
 5638:      maintenance.  (If the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be
 5639:      done, for example, by posting to comp.text.tex.)
 5640: 
 5641:  3a. If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass
 5642:      maintenance of the Work to you, then this takes effect
 5643:      immediately upon announcement.
 5644: 
 5645:   b. If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright
 5646:      Holder agrees that maintenance of the Work be passed to you,
 5647:      then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.
 5648: 
 5649:  4.  If you make an `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above
 5650:      and after three months your intention is challenged neither by
 5651:      the Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other
 5652:      people, then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as
 5653:      to name you as the (new) Current Maintainer.
 5654: 
 5655:  5.  If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes
 5656:      reachable once more within three months of a change completed
 5657:      under the terms of 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must
 5658:      become or remain the Current Maintainer upon request provided
 5659:      they then update their communication data within one month.
 5660: 
 5661: A change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact
 5662: that the Work is distributed under the LPPL license.
 5663: 
 5664: If you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should
 5665: immediately provide, within the Work, a prominent and unambiguous
 5666: statement of your status as Current Maintainer.  You should also
 5667: announce your new status to the same pertinent community as
 5668: in 2b) above.
 5669: 
 5670: 
 5671: WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE
 5672: ======================================================
 5673: 
 5674: This section contains important instructions, examples, and
 5675: recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their
 5676: works under this license.  These authors are addressed as `you' in
 5677: this section.
 5678: 
 5679: Choosing This License or Another License
 5680: ----------------------------------------
 5681: 
 5682: If for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution*
 5683: conditions that differ significantly from those in this license, then
 5684: do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead,
 5685: distribute your work under a different license.  You may use the text
 5686: of this license as a model for your own license, but your license
 5687: should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that
 5688: your work is distributed under the LPPL.
 5689: 
 5690: The document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains
 5691: the motivation behind the conditions of this license.  It explains,
 5692: for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public
 5693: License (GPL) was considered inappropriate.  Even if your work is
 5694: unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be
 5695: relevant, and authors intending to distribute their works under any
 5696: license are encouraged to read it.
 5697: 
 5698: A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution
 5699: -----------------------------------------------------
 5700: 
 5701: It is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own
 5702: personal use, without also meeting the above conditions for
 5703: distributing the modified component.  While you might intend that such
 5704: modifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by
 5705: accident -- you may forget that you have modified that component; or
 5706: it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified
 5707: version that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions
 5708: of this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse,
 5709: cause problems for the community.  It is therefore usually in your
 5710: best interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public
 5711: one.  Many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work
 5712: without altering any of its licensed components.
 5713: 
 5714: How to Use This License
 5715: -----------------------
 5716: 
 5717: To use this license, place in each of the components of your work both
 5718: an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work
 5719: was authored and/or last substantially modified.  Include also a
 5720: statement that the distribution and/or modification of that
 5721: component is constrained by the conditions in this license.
 5722: 
 5723: Here is an example of such a notice and statement:
 5724: 
 5725:   %% pig.dtx
 5726:   %% Copyright 2005 M. Y. Name
 5727:   %
 5728:   % This work may be distributed and/or modified under the
 5729:   % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3
 5730:   % of this license or (at your option) any later version.
 5731:   % The latest version of this license is in
 5732:   %   http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt
 5733:   % and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX
 5734:   % version 2005/12/01 or later.
 5735:   %
 5736:   % This work has the LPPL maintenance status `maintained'.
 5737:   %
 5738:   % The Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name.
 5739:   %
 5740:   % This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins
 5741:   % and the derived file pig.sty.
 5742: 
 5743: Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions
 5744: given in this license document would apply, with the `Work' referring
 5745: to the three files `pig.dtx', `pig.ins', and `pig.sty' (the last being
 5746: generated from `pig.dtx' using `pig.ins'), the `Base Interpreter'
 5747: referring to any `LaTeX-Format', and both `Copyright Holder' and
 5748: `Current Maintainer' referring to the person `M. Y. Name'.
 5749: 
 5750: If you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your
 5751: Work, change `maintained' above into `author-maintained'.
 5752: However, we recommend that you use `maintained', as the Maintenance
 5753: section was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to
 5754: the community even when you can no longer maintain and support it
 5755: yourself.
 5756: 
 5757: Derived Works That Are Not Replacements
 5758: ---------------------------------------
 5759: 
 5760: Several clauses of the LPPL specify means to provide reliability and
 5761: stability for the user community. They therefore concern themselves
 5762: with the case that a Derived Work is intended to be used as a
 5763: (compatible or incompatible) replacement of the original Work. If
 5764: this is not the case (e.g., if a few lines of code are reused for a
 5765: completely different task), then clauses 6b and 6d shall not apply.
 5766: 
 5767: 
 5768: Important Recommendations
 5769: -------------------------
 5770: 
 5771:  Defining What Constitutes the Work
 5772: 
 5773:    The LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the
 5774:    files of the Work.  It is therefore important that you provide a
 5775:    way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work.
 5776:    This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the
 5777:    files of the Work near the copyright notice of each file or by
 5778:    using a line such as:
 5779: 
 5780:     % This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.
 5781: 
 5782:    in that place.  In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be
 5783:    impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you
 5784:    to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be
 5785:    entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise
 5786:    the Work.

 5973: 
 5974: 3. Responsibilities
 5975: -------------------
 5976: 
 5977: 3.1. Distribution of Source Form
 5978: 
 5979: All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
 5980: Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
 5981: the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
 5982: Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
 5983: License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
 5984: attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
 5985: Form.
 5986: 
 5987: 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
 5988: 
 5989: If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
 5990: 
 5991: (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
 5992:     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
 5993:     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
 5994:     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
 5995:     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
 5996: 
 5997: (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
 5998:     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
 5999:     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
 6000:     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
 6001: 
 6002: 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
 6003: 
 6004: You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
 6005: provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
 6006: the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
 6007: Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
 6008: Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
 6009: License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
 6010: under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
 6011: the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
 6012: Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
 6013: License(s).
 6014: 
 6015: 3.4. Notices
 6016: 
 6017: You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
 6018: (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
 6019: or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
 6020: the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
 6021: the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
 6022: 
 6023: 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
 6024: 
 6025: You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
 6026: indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
 6027: Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
 6028: behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
 6029: such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
 6030: You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
 6031: liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
 6032: indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
 6033: disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
 6034: jurisdiction.
 6035: 
 6036: 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
 6037: ---------------------------------------------------
 6038: 
 6039: If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
 6040: License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
 6041: statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
 6042: the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
 6043: describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
 6044: be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
 6045: Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
 6046: or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
 6047: recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
 6048: 
 6049: 5. Termination
 6050: --------------
 6051: 
 6052: 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
 6053: if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
 6054: compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
 6055: Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
 6056: Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
 6057: ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
 6058: non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
 6059: come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
 6060: Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
 6061: notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
 6062: first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
 6063: from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
 6064: Your receipt of the notice.
 6065: 
 6066: 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
 6067: infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
 6068: counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
 6069: directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
 6070: You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
 6071: 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
 6072: 
 6073: 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
 6074: end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
 6075: have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
 6076: prior to termination shall survive termination.

 6439: 
 6440: This Open Software License (the "License") applies to any original work of
 6441: authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the
 6442: following licensing notice adjacent to the copyright notice for the Original
 6443: Work:
 6444: 
 6445: Licensed under the Open Software License version 3.0
 6446: 
 6447: 1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
 6448: non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration of the copyright, to do
 6449: the following:
 6450: 
 6451:   a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a
 6452:   collective work;
 6453: 
 6454:   b) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the Original
 6455:   Work, thereby creating derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the
 6456:   Original Work;
 6457: 
 6458:   c) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and Derivative
 6459:   Works to the public, with the proviso that copies of Original Work or
 6460:   Derivative Works that You distribute or communicate shall be licensed under
 6461:   this Open Software License;
 6462: 
 6463:   d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and
 6464: 
 6465:   e) to display the Original Work publicly.
 6466: 
 6467: 2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
 6468: non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent claims owned or controlled
 6469: by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the
 6470: Licensor, for the duration of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale,
 6471: have made, and import the Original Work and Derivative Works.
 6472: 
 6473: 3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred
 6474: form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available
 6475: documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor agrees to
 6476: provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along
 6477: with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor
 6478: reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable
 6479: copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to
 6480: permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor
 6481: continues to distribute the Original Work.
 6482: 
 6483: 4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names
 6484: of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or
 6485: service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this
 6486: Original Work without express prior permission of the Licensor. Except as
 6487: expressly stated herein, nothing in this License grants any license to
 6488: Licensor's trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other
 6489: intellectual property. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer
 6490: for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent claims other than the
 6491: licensed claims defined in Section 2. No license is granted to the trademarks
 6492: of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in
 6493: this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under
 6494: terms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise
 6495: would have a right to license.
 6496: 
 6497: 5) External Deployment. The term "External Deployment" means the use,
 6498: distribution, or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any
 6499: way such that the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone
 6500: other than You, whether those works are distributed or communicated to those
 6501: persons or made available as an application intended for use over a network.
 6502: As an express condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat
 6503: any External Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a
 6504: distribution under section 1(c).
 6505: 
 6506: 6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative
 6507: Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the
 6508: Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any
 6509: descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause
 6510: the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent
 6511: Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have
 6512: modified the Original Work.
 6513: 
 6514: 7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that
 6515: the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein
 6516: by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the
 6517: terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those
 6518: copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately
 6519: preceding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS
 6520: IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without
 6521: limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for
 6522: a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK
 6523: IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this
 6524: License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this License except
 6525: under this disclaimer.
 6526: 
 6527: 8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,
 6528: whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the
 6529: Licensor be liable to anyone for any indirect, special, incidental, or
 6530: consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or
 6531: the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss
 6532: of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 6533: other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not
 6534: apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
 6535: 
 6536: 9) Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to this
 6537: License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this
 6538: License and all of its terms and conditions. If You distribute or communicate
 6539: copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable
 6540: effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to
 6541: the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake
 6542: the activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative
 6543: Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms
 6544: and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty.
 6545: Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and
 6546: limitations (including "fair use" or "fair dealing"). This License shall
 6547: terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted
 6548: to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section
 6549: 1(c).
 6550: 
 6551: 10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically
 6552: and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this
 6553: License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or
 6554: counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work
 6555: infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action
 6556: alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other
 6557: software or hardware.
 6558: 
 6559: 11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this
 6560: License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the
 6561: Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under
 6562: the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The
 6563: application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
 6564: International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original
 6565: Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be
 6566: subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the
 6567: appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this
 6568: License.
 6569: 
 6570: 12) Attorneys' Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or
 6571: seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
 6572: recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
 6573: attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including
 6574: any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this
 6575: License.
 6576: 
 6577: 13) Miscellaneous. If any provision of this License is held to be
 6578: unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary
 6579: to make it enforceable.
 6580: 
 6581: 14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License,
 6582: whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity
 6583: exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License.
 6584: For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by,
 6585: or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition,
 6586: "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or
 6587: management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership
 6588: of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial
 6589: ownership of such entity.
 6590: 
 6591: 15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise
 6592: restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not
 6593: to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.
 6594: 
 6595: 16) Modification of This License. This License is Copyright В© 2005 Lawrence
 6596: Rosen. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or communicate this License
 6597: without modification. Nothing in this License permits You to modify this
 6598: License as applied to the Original Work or to Derivative Works. However, You
 6599: may modify the text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate your
 6600: modified version (the "Modified License") and apply it to other original works
 6601: of authorship subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in
 6602: any way that your Modified License is the "Open Software License" or "OSL" and
 6603: you may not use those names in the name of your Modified License; (ii) You
 6604: must replace the notice specified in the first paragraph above with the notice
 6605: "Licensed under <insert your license name here>" or with a notice of your own
 6606: that is not confusingly similar to the notice in this License; and (iii) You
 6607: may not claim that your original works are open source software unless your
 6608: Modified License has been approved by Open Source Initiative (OSI) and You
 6609: comply with its license review and certification process.
